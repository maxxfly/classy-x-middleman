      title: "OUR CONCEPT"
      p1: "Classy X design is an artistic project promoting a more inclusive and eco-friendly fashion."
      p2: "Diana Apsara, founder, designer and model, embodies the project by including models outside of the industry standards (from all size, shapes, ages and origins, transgenders, bodmoded, and so on)"
      p3: "The standardization of beauty anguishes me, it robs us of our authenticity. There are so much diversity under-represented in the fashion industry... It must evolve to reflect society more accurately."
      p4: "Classy X Design aims to be more ethical than the curent industry: every creation follows the upcycling principles."
      p5: "We partake in an eco-friendly fashion by rehabilitating secondhand fabrics and materials and we oppose the fast fashion industry which relies on slavery networks."

      p1: "Classy X is a perpetually moving exhibition."
      p2: "Every new creation is primarily used for photoshootings, fashion shows and happenings aiming to challenge the future of fashion."
      p3: "Fashion as an art is a means of expression and communication. By expressing new ways and opportunities through it, we aim to improve fashion as a better, fairer and more egalitarian industry. It's taking the power back. Because we are fed up with the current divisive and exploiting fashion industry."
      p4: "Fashion is not a matter of productivity but of creativity."
      p5: "It should no more be related to overcomsuption but to emotion."
      p6: "We choose to sell only a few pieces of our collections."
      p7: "but you can find them in our e-shop or on handmade markets."

    p1:
      line1: "ClassyX design emerged from a synergy between fellow and artists (models, photographers, makeup artists, stylists, videographer), yearning to escape mainstream fashion."
      line2: "Working on the whole design, the model and designer Diana Apsara's earnest desire is to create a more inclusive and diverse space."
    cite1:
      line1: "I have always been fascinated by the multiplicity of figures."
      line2: "While creating, I like to image the type of person whom it might fit. I work with a slightly reversed approach compared to most creators. The standardization of beauty anguishes me, it robs us of our authenticity."
      line3: "I am not interested in creating a divise fashion, but in uniting, blending and mingling different beauty types."
    p2:
      line1: "ClassyX design selects just as many atypical models, transgendered, plus sized and body modded, as classic models."
    cite2:
      line1: "Fashion has a responsibility towards people it sets aside by forcing an homogeneous image of beauty. When it tries its hand at variance, it is often just for a short buzz-worthy moment.
          It ressemble more exploitation than integration."
    p3:
      line1: "Participating members of the ClassyX design project are mostly women, plus sized or originating from the LGBT community.
         Being directly representative of the public it addresses: empowerment without compromise."
    p4:
      line1: "As part of a more ethical fashion logic, the handmade creations are made from recycled fabrics or upcycled."
      line2: "Some creations are regularly available in the online store."
      line3: "The project is a collaboration between Paris, Londres and Montréal, with the aspiration of spreading to other cities:"
      line4: "ClassyX design is in permanent evolution and aims to grow."
