      title: "FASHION HOUSE"
      p1: "Classy X Design isn't just another fashion house: it's breaking free from the elitist and materialistic ways of conventional fashion houses. Questioning mere consumerism and empowering people to stop being passive consumers, it is instead urging them to become active participants."
      p2: "In this day and age, we're still living to the tune of the economic growth model. This system is deadly for the planet as it is for humanity."
      p3: "Are possession and domination the only ways to exist? We believe that another world is possible: creation, building connections, placing empathy and care at the heart of our ways of living..."
      p4: "Through our initiatives, we aim to prove that it is possible to engage with fashion in a more humane and supportive way."

      title: "THE STORY OF CLASSY X DESIGN"
      p1: "2018 is the year that the designer and visual artist Diana Apsara founded the collective Classy X Design."
      p2: "Over the years, the collective has grown into a fashion house relying on a cooperative model. This change marks a turning point: the house expands its scope by opening the project to the transmission of skills through the creation of collaborative workshops providing lessons in the basics of upcycling."
      p3: "Rather than consuming without questioning, we invite people to rethink fashion, reclaiming its transformative power and raising consciousness from an eco-queer and anti-consumerist perspective."
    share:
      title: "SHARE"
      p1: "Follow us on social networks to keep in touch and share our project with your friends."
      p2: "Don't be a fashion victim anymore, be tomorrow fashion influencer!"

    p1:
      line1: "ClassyX design emerged from a synergy between fellow and artists (models, photographers, makeup artists, stylists, videographer), yearning to escape mainstream fashion."
      line2: "Working on the whole design, the model and designer Diana Apsara's earnest desire is to create a more inclusive and diverse space."
    cite1:
      line1: "I have always been fascinated by the multiplicity of figures."
      line2: "While creating, I like to image the type of person whom it might fit. I work with a slightly reversed approach compared to most creators. The standardization of beauty anguishes me, it robs us of our authenticity."
      line3: "I am not interested in creating a divise fashion, but in uniting, blending and mingling different beauty types."
    p2:
      line1: "ClassyX design selects just as many atypical models, transgendered, plus sized and body modded, as classic models."
    cite2:
      line1: "Fashion has a responsibility towards people it sets aside by forcing an homogeneous image of beauty. When it tries its hand at variance, it is often just for a short buzz-worthy moment.
          It ressemble more exploitation than integration."
    p3:
      line1: "Participating members of the ClassyX design project are mostly women, plus sized or originating from the LGBT community.
         Being directly representative of the public it addresses: empowerment without compromise."
    p4:
      line1: "As part of a more ethical fashion logic, the handmade creations are made from recycled fabrics or upcycled."
      line2: "Some creations are regularly available in the online store."
      line3: "The project is a collaboration between Paris, Londres and Montréal, with the aspiration of spreading to other cities:"
      line4: "ClassyX design is in permanent evolution and aims to grow."
